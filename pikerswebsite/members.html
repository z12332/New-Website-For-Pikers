					<p>Jeremy's favorite restaurant is Beta Frattoria. Unfortunately, Jeremy was banned for life from said restaurant after found having intimate relations with the chef's daughter on the chef's own personal bed. He often misses Pikers rehearsals because he is napping or hammocking with his WUSA. Jeremy is infatuated with people named Julian. If not wearing a jean jacket and dark sunglasses in public, Jeremy can often be found with the Jews.</p>

					<h2>Pranav Buggana</h2>
					<p>Hometown: Hyderabad, India<br>Voice Part: Tenor<br>Class of 2019 - Major: ???<br></p> <!-- Invisible Spacer -->
					<p>Pranav Buggana was born in an Indian Village. At the wee age of five, Pranav knew how to fire a bow and arrow. By age 10, Pranav could carve his own canoe and forage for the finest herbs known to Krishna. After a particularly nasty game of slum dog millionaire, Pranav was brutally mauled by a bear for 15 minutes. So he began a perilous journey across miles of dangerous wilderness to track down the men who killed his family. Replacing Rishub as our token Indian, Pranav brings an enthusiasm to The Pikers previously displayed only by lab rats experimented on with cocaine. The bear died by asphyxiation, and it is Pranav's dream to one day grow a mustache.</p>

					<p>Although many of The Pikers are very fond of plants, Drew is the sole member of The Pikers who is absolutely obsessed with carnivorous plants. Drew first became fascinated with carnivorous plants after seeing Little Shop Of Horrors as a child. By age 13, Drew had bred over six thousand different types of carnivorous plants. Each day after school, Drew would rush off the bus, head to his room, and begin the daily 4-hour task of feeding flies to all of his plants. As Drew told Carnivorous Plant Weekly, "There is no greater feeling in the world than watching one of my plants consume a house fly" (34). Unfortunately, Drew's career as a botanist was cut short when Drew brought his favorite plant to school for show and tell. When Drew's Math teacher tried to hold Esther, he lost an arm. Drew was sent to the Pennsylvania Children's Correction Facility for the Mentally Insane Obsessed With Plants That Eat Things, where he remains to this day.</p>

					<p>RJ was raised by 7 dwarves who forced him to play trumpet for them 24/7 on threat of death. Whenever The Pikers sing a spiritual chant or soulful melody, Randy receives the solo due to the rest of the group's belief that RJ is in fact Randy Jackson. This is not at all racist, as The Pikers are especially diverse this year. Although he does not claim to be the Fresh Prince of Virginia, RJ is the Fresh Prince of Virginia. When asked to speak at the Randy Jackson Fresh Prince of Virginia Rally FOR THE CURE, RJ contributed a single sentence: "I am famished." The crowd, overjoyed to hear an American Idol judge speak, immediately threw him their sandwiches, and RJ was pleased.</p>

					<h2>Brandon Mendez</h2>
					<p>Hometown: Pembroke Pines, FL<br>Voice Part: Bass<br>Class of 2019 - Major: ???<br></p> <!-- Invisible Spacer -->
					<p>Brandon is absolutely infatuated with Poptarts, to the point of concern. He often brings them to class and offers them to his professors, who immediately tell Brandon a poptart won't do jackshit after sleeping through Writing 1 due to a night of "fun times and good vibes for all." Brandon spends all of his time trying to control his 19 pet ducklings, one of which is alarmingly loud, obnoxious and doesn't seem to understand he is not allowed to quack while Brandon teaches music (the ugly duckling is Porter). It has long been rumored but never proven that Brandon has or at least had a girlfriend. After selling his ducks to the highest bidder, Brandon plans to write his memoir and then retire to his hometown of Mexico to search for the lost city of "El Dorado."</p>

					<h2>JohnJake Mattingly</h2>
					<p>Hometown: St. Louis, MO<br>Voice Part: Tenor<br>Class of 2019 - Major: Undecided<br>Prime Minister<br></p> <!-- Invisible Spacer -->
					<p>John Jake is the sole member and founder of the I.F.I.W.T.F.N. (Institution For Individuals With Two First Names). Citing Ricky Bobby, George Michael, and Elton John as major influences, John Jake has worked extensively throughout his college career to promote his group, while simultaneously bankrupting The Greenleafs by funding the I.F.I.W.T.F.N. with their money (which "exists"). Although John Jake is obsessive about sheep, sadly all the sheep from John Jake's hometown of St. Louis have fled to California. Upon learning of his precious sheep leaving forever, John Jake commented, "Hey man." John Jake also spends his free time filling in as a Christmas tree on the set of St. Louis University High's production of "A Midsummer's Wet Dream."</p>

					<h2>Anirudh Gandhi</h2>
					<p>Hometown: Mumbai, India<br>Voice Part: Tenor<br>Class of 2020 - Major: Undecided<br></p> <!-- Invisible Spacer -->
					<p>Anirudh was born on the desert planet of Tatooine to parents Shmi and The Force. Although his closest friends often reprimand him for this, Ani has a nasty habit of comparing the quality of exciting new life experiences to the joy he derives from podracing. A small green fellow once approached Ani and offered him a bid to his favorite fraternity(TM), but he became visibly ill when he realized that a main stipulation to entry was reading (and re-reading) the Ancient Jedi Texts. Addressing him by the name "Rudi" will immediately turn him to the dark side, so one must exercise extreme nomenclatural caution. When Ani grows up, he dreams to one day diddle the queen's decoy and rule everything from the Inner Core to the Outer Rim. But until Order 66 passes, he'll just stick to podracing. Oh, and soccer.</p>

					<h2>Chudi Mbanefo</h2>
					<p>Hometown: Northridge, CA<br>Voice Part: Baritone<br>Class of 2020 - Major: Chemical Engineering<br>Assistant Minister of Pitch<br></p> <!-- Invisible Spacer -->
					<p>Despite countless surgeries, treatments, and second opinions, Chudi continues to suffer from Shoulder Hyperactivity Incapacitative Tremors. He can normally keep his S.H.I.T. together during most of rehearsal, but the moment he gains any power the motor regions of his brain go total seizure mode. Luckily, this debilitating condition is remedied by playing any sort of party music, the sound of which invigorates Chudi's tender bod to commence rhythmic gyration. This can be off-putting to most potential mates, but The Pikers will do anything to keep Chudi healthy and his condition stable. When Chudi is not plotting the untimely demise of whoever holds the position of Music Director, he can be found doing it for state.</p>
